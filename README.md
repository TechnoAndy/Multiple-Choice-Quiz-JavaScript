# Multiple-Choice-Quiz-JavaScript

This is a JavaScript-based multiple-choice quiz. In this quiz, users will be presented with three answer choices and must select the correct one within a 10-second time limit. If a user fails to answer within the allotted time, the quiz will automatically move on to the next question and mark the current question as incorrect. Additionally, there will be a progress bar to display the total number of questions and indicate whether the user answered each question correctly or not.
